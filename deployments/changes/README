# 3. Changes
################################################################################


This folder should contain updates or changes to the schema 
and seed data for the database.  Multiple changes can be in a 
single file, but all changes must be additive.  This means 
that there should never be a rollback and redeploy.  A rollback 
would be executed as a change, and the re-deployment as yet
another change. Rollbacks should still be created for 
changes written and should be stored in the rollbacks directory
even though if they are used they will be added into the 
changes directory as a new file. Development and testing strategies
may utilize different strategies for dealing with rollbacks, but
once something is merged to master, you have to consider that
other people may have that checked out and deployed which is
why you should treat all changes on master as additive to ensure
a consistent database state.

Deploying updates in an additive fashion allows any developer
to check out the database and not worry about their checkout
being invalidated.

Files here should be named with the date in format:
YYYYMMDD-[XX-][description_of_change].sql

where YYYY is the 4 digit year, MM is the 2 digit month, DD is
the 2 digit day

XX- is an optional argument that can be used if there are more than
one script associated with a change.  The numbers should be incrmental
ordering the scripts in an alpha sort. 

The description should not have any spaces in it.  Instead underscores 
should be used.

When changes are baselined, they are moved to the archive
direcotry and their contents are merged into the correct schema 
or seed data file.
