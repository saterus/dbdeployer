# 1. Schema
################################################################################

This folder should contain the entire schema for the database.  Files should be
preceeded with a numerical value starting with 1000 and increment by 1000 as
applicable if more than one file needs to be referenced to instantiate the 
schema.  

In the event we come up with a file that should be executed between existing 
files, then pick the number in the middle of the two scripts surrounding the
new script.  For example.  if I have script 1000.sql which executes first, and
script 2000.sql that executes second and I want to add something that executes
between those two files, but for logistical reasons should remain separate
and not get merged to the end or beginning of one of those files, then that file
should be named 1500.sql.

Ideally there is only one sql file that exists and gets called, but if there 
was a desire to break up schema, stored procedures/functions, triggers, etc
a multi-file system can handle this approach.
